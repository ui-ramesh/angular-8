About the work
I just started to create some concept and its just on the starting phase;

I was able to add few concept and few explaination is below: and CSS is not completed yet;


When the page loaded, we will see three different tabs;

I applied simple routing to these tabs..(as we click differnt tab)

On the first tab we have mat table;

we can filter the data file the filter is just above the table

when we click the name on the table cell, mat dialog box pop up, I created simnple dialog box and it also I send the data 
from the table row  to dialog box

I used simple mat table to dispaly data and use the local json and use http call( local file);

we have 2nd tab as Image 
In this tab I implement to display image dynamically along iwth the image title and subtile and focus remains  on teh face of the image

it is dynamic and just created a local json file and make a call; position- y is also display dynmically

In searchForm
Css look really bad and I just want to demonstrate  very simnple  concept of component commumicaton in angular

I did @Input with custom propetry for Parent COmpone to child component communication

I did @Output with eventEmitter/event binding to have children to parent component communication
